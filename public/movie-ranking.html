<h2>My top 3 action movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spider-man: No way Home</h3>
<p>
  I can't stop gushing over how all my childhood and current favourite villains
  and spider-men (see what I've done there? haha) were all gathered in one frame.
  <br />
  I ugly cried!
</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>This movie's action sequences made me jump off my seat a couple of times. Loved it!</p>

<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>
  What can I say? <br/>Yes to the cinematography. Yes to the action sequences. Yes to
  the storyline. 100/10!
